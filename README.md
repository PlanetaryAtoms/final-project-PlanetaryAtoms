Java-Top-5 recommendation project:

To run this program, execute the Main.java file then wait for the program to finish calculating the similarity table.
You should see the program do each calculation one after the other. It took me around 1 minute for the program to finish 
with the given dataset. Once you are done and you should see the program output- 'Finishing creating recommendations!' 
'Check the 'output.txt' file for the results. 

You will need to either find the file in your folder with the program in it. The other way would be to go to the File tab in your 
IDE or editor and refresh the application. I did this in Eclipse: Go to File-Refresh or push F5 on your keyboard. 

You should see the output.txt file in the folder in the Package Explorer for this project. Once you click to check it, you should 
see a formatted list of movies with their ratings from users' making up a top-5 recommedation system.
